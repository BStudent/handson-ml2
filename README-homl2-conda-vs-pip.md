# (bstudent) Conda vs. pip for installing HoML2 requisites

So far it's no contest, conda is much better than pip for pulling in the packages required by the book.

This despite TF essentially being supported / documented in a pip/virtualenv-centric environment. 

Environment: Pop_OS 19.10, both on an oryx pro 4 laptop (gtx 1070) and a multi-gpu tower desktop / server.
